        <p>This TP was a completion of the work done in class. </p>
        <p>
        All wanted features were implemented, these include:
        - Adding new students (<b>POST</b> /students/:number)
        - Deleting students (<b>DELETE</b> /students/:number)
        - Editing data from students (<b>PUT</b> /students/:number)
        - We can also view the tpcs of a specific student (<b>GET</b> /students/:number)
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML Forms don't allow other method other than GET or POST so, it was used method-override for app method translation.
            This allows the app to receive a POST with a parameter in the query string _method with the value to override the http method.
            With this we could implement successfully DELETE and PUT for the student data
